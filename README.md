Live Demo: Expense Tracker

https://smartspend-sx51.onrender.com/

💻Tech Stack:

• Backend: Python (Flask)

• Database: PostgreSQL

• Validation: Pydantic

• Deployment: Render (CI/CD Pipeline)

• ORM: Flask-SQLAlchemy

• Version Control: Git/GitHub

🎉Key Features:

• Dynamic Data Modeling: Implemented a relational database schema allowing for user-defined categories with associated real-time expense tracking.

• One-to-Many Relationships: Engineered the backend to support complex data associations, where each unique category dynamically aggregates its nested expense entries.

• User Authentication: Secure signup/login with Pydantic data validation and encrypted password storage.

• Expense Management: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) financial transactions.

• Data Integrity: Robust backend validation ensures every expense has a valid amount, date, and category.

• Cloud Hosted: Fully deployed on Render with an automated CI/CD pipeline.


🗡️Architecture and DevOps

This project isn't just a site; it's a demonstration of modern development workflows:

• CI/CD Pipeline: Integrated GitHub-to-Render deployment. Every code push automatically triggers a new build and deployment.

• Database Management: Uses Flask-Migrate to handle schema changes without data loss.

• Environment Security: Sensitive credentials (API keys, DB URLs) are managed through server-side environment variables, never exposed in the source code.
